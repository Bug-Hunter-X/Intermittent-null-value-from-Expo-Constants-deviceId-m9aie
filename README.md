# Expo Constants.deviceId Returns Null Intermittently

This repository demonstrates a bug where `Expo.Constants.deviceId` returns `null` unexpectedly. This issue prevents the application from reliably identifying the device, causing problems with features that depend on a unique identifier.

## Problem Description

The `Constants.deviceId` property, which usually provides a stable unique identifier for the device, sometimes returns `null`. This occurs sporadically, making it hard to pinpoint the exact cause.  The null value interferes with functionalities that rely on device identification, such as user authentication or analytics tracking.

## Solution

The provided solution implements a fallback mechanism that attempts to retrieve the device ID multiple times or uses an alternative identification strategy if `Constants.deviceId` continues to return `null` after multiple attempts.
