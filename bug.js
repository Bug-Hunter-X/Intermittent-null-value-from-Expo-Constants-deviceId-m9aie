This bug occurs when using the Expo Constants module to access device-specific information, specifically the `deviceId` property.  In some cases, `Constants.deviceId` returns `null` even when the device has a unique identifier. This can happen intermittently and seems to be related to certain conditions under which the app starts or the device is used, making it difficult to reproduce reliably.
